# XML
This is the XLST code I wrote to allow an Umbraco site to display an XML feed.

Here is the page with the XML feed:
<a href="http://davisvilletravel.com/big-five.aspx">http://davisvilletravel.com/big-five.aspx</a>

My comments within the code are meant to help the front-end developer understand the code and be able to change it herself without learning XLST.
